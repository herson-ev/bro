This branch allows the user to choose the analyzers that will be loaded to the
tree associated with every connection.

The configuration file looks like this:
===========
HTTP 1
SSH 0
SSL 1
SMTP 1
DNS 1
===========
Where 1 means that the analyzer will be loeade into the tree and 0 means that
the analyzer will not be loaded.
The path to this configuration file is hardcoded in 
bro/src/analyzer/CustomAnalyzerLoader.h so please modify it accordingly.

To build this branch it is necessary to add the "--enable-c++11" flag.
In 3 steps:
1) ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --enable-c++11
2) make
3) make install
